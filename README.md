## Everyday Code: Learning, Exploring, Growingâ€”one line at a time!

Welcome to my Daily Coding Solutions repository! I'm Akshat Khatri, currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm in my first year and am incredibly excited and enthusiastic about technology.

Here, you'll find my daily codes. Additionally, this repository will evolve beyond LeetCode to encompass a broader spectrum of coding challenges, exploring various aspects of Full Stack Development and other technologies that I'll be learning throughout my engineering journey.

## from day131 or so onwards my progress will not be in respective directories due to limitations in the react js directory structure , though i am maintaining a commit history and you can check the logs for updates or just peek in the react_js directory :)

## Usage

    Navigate to the specific day's folder: Each solution is neatly organized in its dedicated file, such as Day1, Day2, and so forth.

    Explore the solution and get inspired: Delve into the world of coding challenges and DSA development by examining the solution within the DayX.cpp file. Along with the code, you'll find a daily dose of motivation to keep you energized on your coding adventure.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you're eager to add your solutions, share your unique lines of code, or offer valuable feedback, please don't hesitate to send me a message on LinkedIn. My colleagues and I conduct a live class every day, engaging in discussions about various coding problems, DSA development, Full Stack Development, and more. We've just embarked on our coding journey, and your insights are more than welcome.
